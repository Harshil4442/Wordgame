<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

- Welcome to the Word Game project, an interactive and engaging online game where users can join together in rooms to unleash their creativity and guessing skills! In this game, players take turns drawing a given word while others attempt to guess the correct word based on the drawing.<br/><br/>


### Features

- **Real-time Collaboration:** This game works in real time beacause multiple users will be selecting and guessing the word in real time. Also the scoring system will work in real time.<br/>
- **Drawing Mechanism:** There is drawing features in this project in which there are four types of tools: pencil, reactangle, circle and erase. Here i have used React Konva for the page of the drawing and that tools.<br/>
- **Room Creation and Joining:** Users can join the room by giving their username and roomID. If entered roomID is currently existing then user will be assign that room but if that roomID is not exist a new room with that roomID will be created for that user. <br />
